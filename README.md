##Domain Babel

Domain Babel is a single page web application that allows the user to find any words contained in their domain name.
It cuts up the domain name in strings of three characters or more and uses a translation API to find any translations for those words in more than 40 languages.

###Background
Domain Babel was a personal side project which I used to gain some experience with the following tools and frameworks:
- Windows Azure Websites
- Windows Azure Table Storage
- Microsoft Bing Translation API
- SimpleInjector (IoC)
- SignalR (real-time search results pushed to the client)
- Async C# (speed up search tasks by executing them asynchronously)
- KnockoutJS (client-side MVVM)
- MSTest (used in VS2013 Express)
- OpenCover (for code coverage)
